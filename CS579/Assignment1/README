Notes on submitted work:

1) An attempt was made to write the Map and Reduce functions in Python and use Hadoop Streaming to train
   the model. This was ultimately unsuccessful, but the code is attached for the grader's consideration.
   If one is to run a pipeline (e.g. cat data.csv | python mapper.py | python reducer.py), the code is
   able to perform the task at hand. Perhap the issue is my inexperience and not being able to figure out
   Hadoop Streaming properly
2) Apache Spark implementation for actual results obtained was done in a Google Colab notebook.
